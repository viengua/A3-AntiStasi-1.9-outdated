# Discontinued project

In over a year this project added many features which are not as functional as it is the [current Antistasi](https://github.com/A3Antistasi/Antistasi-WotP), the official community discontinued this project in favor of the other.

# Credits

After 1.2 *Chris* coded many changes under the supervision of *RickyTan* and *Kendo* with the contribution of *Toshi* and *Tucks* for porting and templates.

After 1.7.6 *Sparker* and *Jeroen* continued because the 1.7 bugs weren't possible to be fixed unless changing a lot of the code.

*Stef* started supervising since 1.7.17 with great help of *IrLED* who started the github project and coded major core fixes and improvement such as proportional distribution of AI to headlessclients,lightened spawned script etc.

*Triada* adapted the mission for multi-language translation updating Stringtable.xml and harmonizing hints and task display. He translated, with support of Russian community, the mission to Russian. Also, *Nemesti* added the Spanish translation.

*Stef*, Wurzel0701 and Zalexki continued the develop branch untill Barbolani released the current A3-Antistasi
